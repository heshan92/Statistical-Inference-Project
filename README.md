Introduction:
We conducted this survey throughout a week period and we ended up with 218 valid responses. We used a mixed approach to do the data collection in this survey. This include collecting data through online survey, phone survey and interview voters going door to door. Sample of these voters selected randomly to avoid sampling bias. We decided to limit this study to western province and only consider educated youth segment due to the time frame and the cost of data collection. Since educated youth segment can do a significant influence to the overall election results we reframed our objective to identify the candidates popular among educated youth segment in western province and how they prioritize the national policies.
